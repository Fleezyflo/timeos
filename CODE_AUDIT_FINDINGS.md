# Code Audit Findings

This document summarizes the findings of a full codebase audit.

## Directory: `src/0_bootstrap/`

*   **Directory Purpose:** This directory is responsible for the most critical startup tasks: defining global constants, setting up the dependency injection container, and establishing error handling. It is the first set of files to be executed.
*   **Directory Health:** <span style="color:red">**CRITICAL**</span>

### File Status & Analysis

*   **`AA_Container.gs`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:orange">**MODIFIED**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** This file has been correctly modified to address the initialization errors.
        *   **Fix:** The `DependencyContainer` class and the `const container` instantiation have been moved to the top of the file.
        *   **Reason:** This guarantees the `container` object exists before any other script tries to use it, fixing the `TypeError: container.has is not a function` error.
        *   **Fix:** The duplicate, partial `BatchOperations` class has been removed.
        *   **Reason:** This helps resolve the `SyntaxError: Identifier 'BatchOperations' has already been declared`.

*   **`AA_Container.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** This file is a full, separate implementation of the `DependencyContainer` class. Its presence creates a duplicate declaration of `class DependencyContainer` and `const container` because both `AA_Container.gs` and `AA_Container.js` are loaded by the runtime.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is a primary source of the initialization errors. One of these container definitions must be removed.

*   **`AB_Constants.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** This file re-declares the `CONSTANTS`, `SHEET_NAMES`, and `SERVICES` objects that are already defined in `AA_Container.gs`.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is the cause of the `Identifier has already been declared` errors for constants. This file is redundant.

*   **`AC_Enums.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** This file declares `STATUS`, `PRIORITY`, and other enums that are also declared in `AA_Container.gs`.
    *   **Conclusion:** Another source of `Identifier has already been declared` errors.

*   **`LoggerFacade.gs` and `LoggerFacade.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** These two files contain identical code, leading to a duplicate declaration of `const LoggerFacade`.
    *   **Conclusion:** One of these files must be removed.

*   **`Preload.gs` and `Preload.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** These files are identical, causing duplicate declarations for all functions within them (`safeLog`, `globalErrorHandler`, etc.).
    *   **Conclusion:** One of these files must be removed.

*   **`RunAllTests.gs` and `RunAllTests.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** Identical files, causing duplicate function declarations.
    *   **Conclusion:** One must be removed.

*   **`SheetHealer.gs` and `SheetHealer.js`**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:red">**PROBLEM**</span>
    *   **Analysis:** Identical files, causing a duplicate declaration of the `SheetHealer` class.
    *   **Conclusion:** One must be removed.

*   **`AZ_ServiceRegistration.gs`**
    *   **Status:** OK
    *   **Analysis:** This file correctly uses the `container` object to register all system services. It is dependent on the container being properly initialized first.

### Bootstrap Directory Summary

The `0_bootstrap` directory is the epicenter of the initialization failures. The core issue is the presence of both `.gs` and `.js` versions of nearly every file. The Apps Script runtime attempts to load both, causing immediate `SyntaxError` because every class, function, and constant is declared twice.
